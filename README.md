# SolúnikaAgent

## About
SolúnikaAgent is an experimental framework designed to simulate human-like interactions through a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent. It facilitates the creation of custom agents equipped with unique tools and senses, enabling them to react and adapt dynamically to their environment. The flexible structure of SolúnikaAgent allows extensive customization and scalability, encouraging developers to explore innovative extensions.

## Introduction
The SolúnikaAgent model emulates human cognitive processes such as thinking, decision-making, planning, and acting. This experimental framework explores the feasibility of developing an agent that separates decision-making from external stimuli, creating a more autonomous artificial intelligence.

### Draft Architecture:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Agent] --> B[Consciousness]
    A --> C[Senses]
    A --> D[Skills]
    A --> E[Long Term Memory]
    A --> F[Short Term Memory]

    B --> G[Decision Making Process]
    C --> H[Information Gathering]
    D --> I[Action Execution]

    H --> G
    G --> I

    I --> J[World Interaction]
    J --> C

```

### Key Components:
- **Long Term Memory (LTM):** Stores all learned information, aiding the agent in informed decision-making.
- **Short Term Memory (STM):** Temporarily holds necessary data for immediate decision processes, which is discarded once a decision is made.
- **Consciousness:** Acts as the decision-making core of the agent.
- **Senses:** Gather information from the environment to inform decisions.
- **Skills:** Utilize tools to interact effectively with the environment and execute actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SolúnikaAgent.git
cd SolúnikaAgent
npm install
```

### Usage

To deploy the SolúnikaAgent framework:

	1.	Create a new agent.
	2.	Define and integrate the desired senses, skills, and tools.
	3.	Initialize the agent with the following command:

	```bash
	node examples/test.js
	```


### Example	

Here is a simple example of how to set up and run a SolúnikaAgent:

```javascript
// Import the necessary classes and libraries
const { Agent, Sense, Skill } = require('SolúnikaAgent');

// Initialize the agent
let myAgent = new Agent("ExampleAgent");

// Add senses and skills
myAgent.addSense(new Sense("Vision"));
myAgent.addSkill(new Skill("Communication"));

// Execute the agent
myAgent.activate();
```
